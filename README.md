A simple sudoku game for keeping my brain working during some longer projects and not fully crashing out.
It’s minimal, black & white, and way too over-engineered for something that’s basically “fill in some numbers.”

## Tests

Yes i wrote tests for this bad boy. They pass. Sometimes.
Mostly they just reassure me that the puzzles are solvable — unlike life.

## Contributing

Just kidding, if you find a bug, fix it. I’ve already moved on emotionally.
